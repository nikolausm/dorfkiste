- All external URLs are environment-aware
- API calls use relative paths (correct approach)

## Recommendations

- Consider adding `/watchlist` to the authenticated navigation menu
- Add `/admin` link for admin users in the navigation dropdown

### 2. URL Pattern Consistency:
- All URLs follow consistent patterns ✅
- Proper use of kebab-case ✅
- Logical grouping (e.g., `/help/*`, `/auth/*`) ✅

### 3. Security Best Practices:

- Environment-based configuration for services ✅
- No exposed internal URLs ✅

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing Checklist:
1. Click through all navigation links

5. Verify API endpoint responses

### Automated Testing:
Consider implementing E2E tests for critical user journeys:
