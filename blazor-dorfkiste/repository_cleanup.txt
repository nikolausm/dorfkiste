Repository cleanup instructions (bin/obj and other generated files)

Context:
- .gitignore updated at repo root (/Users/michaelnikolaus/RiderProjects/dorfkiste/.gitignore) to ignore .NET build artifacts (bin/, obj/), IDE files, test results, and logs.
- Some of these files are currently tracked. Run the following commands from the Git repository root (/Users/michaelnikolaus/RiderProjects/dorfkiste):

Commands:
1) Remove currently tracked build artifacts from the index (keep files locally):
   git rm -r --cached "**/bin" "**/obj" "**/TestResults" "**/.vs" "**/logs" "*.sln.DotSettings.user"

2) Optionally clear more generated files if present (safe to run):
   git rm -r --cached "**/*.log" "**/*.log.*"

3) Verify what will be committed:
   git status

4) Commit the cleanup:
   git commit -m "chore(git): ignore .NET build artifacts and untrack bin/ obj/ TestResults/ logs/"

5) Push the changes:
   git push

Note:
- If history rewrite is desired to purge artifacts from previous commits, consider using:
   git filter-repo or git filter-branch (advanced; not required for basic cleanup).
