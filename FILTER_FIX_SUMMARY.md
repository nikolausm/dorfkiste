# Category Filter Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

1. **Replaced `window.location.href` with Next.js Router**
   - Changed from hard page reloads to smooth client-side navigation
   - Used `useRouter` hook from `next/navigation` for navigation
   - Results update without full page reload

2. **Improved Filter State Management**
   - Filters now persist across navigation
   - URL parameters are properly synchronized with filter state
   - Added helper function `buildFilterUrl` for consistent URL building

3. **Enhanced Category Navigation**
   - Category links now use router.push instead of Link components
   - Filters are preserved when switching categories
   - Active category highlighting works correctly

4. **Added Reset Filters Button**
   - Shows only when filters are active
   - Clears all filters and navigates to base /items page
   - Provides better user experience

5. **Fixed Filter Combinations**
   - All filter combinations work correctly together
   - Search parameter is preserved when applying filters
   - Proper URL parameter encoding for special characters
