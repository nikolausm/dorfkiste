- ‚úÖ JWT tokens with user ID included

### 6. Security Features
- ‚úÖ Password hashing with bcryptjs
- ‚úÖ Security logging for all authentication events

- ‚úÖ Email enumeration prevention
- ‚úÖ Secure token generation for password reset
- ‚úÖ Input validation middleware

## Critical Issues to Fix üö®

### 1. Missing NEXTAUTH_SECRET
**Issue**: The `.env` file is missing the `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` variable, which is **required** for NextAuth to function properly.
**Impact**: Without this, JWT signing will fail and authentication won't work.
**Fix**: Add to `.env`:
```env
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-generated-secret-here"
```
Generate with: `openssl rand -base64 32`

### 2. Missing NEXTAUTH_URL
**Issue**: The `.env` file is missing the `NEXTAUTH_URL` variable.
**Impact**: Callbacks and redirects may not work correctly.
**Fix**: Add to `.env`:
```env
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
```

### 3. Missing Error Page
**Issue**: `/auth/error/page.tsx` is referenced in the auth configuration but doesn't exist.
**Impact**: Authentication errors will result in a 404 page.
**Fix**: Create the error page to handle authentication errors gracefully.

### 4. Missing Password Reset Page
**Issue**: The password reset flow generates a link to `/auth/reset-password` but this page doesn't exist.
**Impact**: Users cannot complete the password reset process.
**Fix**: Implement the reset password page and API endpoint.

### 5. Database Connection
**Issue**: Using SQLite with file-based connection might not be suitable for production.
**Impact**: Performance and concurrency issues in production.
**Recommendation**: Consider PostgreSQL for production as configured in `.env.example`.

### 6. Missing Email Configuration
**Issue**: Email service configuration is incomplete in `.env`.
**Impact**: Welcome emails and password reset emails won't be sent.
**Fix**: Add email configuration:
```env
RESEND_API_KEY="your-resend-api-key"
FROM_EMAIL="noreply@dorfkiste.com"
ADMIN_EMAIL="admin@dorfkiste.com"
```

## Security Recommendations üõ°Ô∏è

### 1. Environment Variables
- **Critical**: Remove the exposed OpenAI API key from the repository
- Store all sensitive configuration in environment variables
- Use `.env.local` for local development (git-ignored)
- Never commit `.env` files with real credentials

### 2. Password Policy
- Current minimum: 6 characters (weak)
- Recommendation: Increase to 8+ characters
- Add complexity requirements (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols)
- Implement password strength indicator

### 3. Session Security
- Consider adding session expiration
- Implement refresh token rotation
- Add device/location tracking for sessions

### 4. Additional Security Measures
- Implement account lockout after failed attempts
- Add two-factor authentication (2FA)
- Email verification for new accounts
- Implement CSRF protection (NextAuth handles this)

## Implementation Checklist üìã

### Immediate Actions (Critical)
- [ ] Add `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` to `.env`
- [ ] Add `NEXTAUTH_URL` to `.env`
- [ ] Remove exposed API keys from repository
- [ ] Create `/auth/error/page.tsx`
- [ ] Implement `/auth/reset-password/page.tsx`
- [ ] Add reset password API endpoint

### Short-term Improvements
- [ ] Configure email service (Resend)
- [ ] Strengthen password requirements
- [ ] Add email verification flow
- [ ] Implement session expiration
- [ ] Add better error messages

### Long-term Enhancements
- [ ] Migrate to PostgreSQL for production
- [ ] Implement 2FA
- [ ] Add OAuth providers (Google, GitHub)
- [ ] Implement account lockout mechanism
- [ ] Add audit trail for authentication events
- [ ] Implement device management

## Testing Recommendations üß™

### Unit Tests
- Test password hashing and verification
- Test JWT token generation and validation
- Test rate limiting functionality
- Test input validation

### Integration Tests
- Test complete sign-up flow
- Test sign-in with valid/invalid credentials
- Test password reset flow
- Test session persistence

### Security Tests
- Test for SQL injection vulnerabilities
- Test for timing attacks on login
- Test rate limiting effectiveness
- Test session hijacking prevention

## Conclusion

The Dorfkiste authentication system has a solid foundation with most components properly implemented. However, it cannot function without the critical environment variables (`NEXTAUTH_SECRET` and `NEXTAUTH_URL`). Once these configuration issues are resolved and the missing pages are implemented, the system will provide a secure authentication experience.

The use of modern security practices like bcrypt for password hashing, rate limiting, and comprehensive logging shows good security awareness. With the recommended improvements, particularly around password policies and session management, the system will meet production security standards.

**Priority Action**: Add the missing environment variables immediately to make the authentication system functional.
